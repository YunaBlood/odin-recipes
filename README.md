Create a recipe website

I used HTML to create a recipe website, I used heading 1-2 to give importance to content in my page.

I used unordered list and ordered list to list ingredients, steps to follow.

I nested my anchor tag into list element to add readability and to not have all my link inline.

I added on my img tag the alt attribute to describe the image and used the height and width attribute to stop the flickering of the image when refreshing the page
