Create a recipe website

I used HTML to create a recipe website, I used heading 1-2 to give importance to content in my page.

I used unordered list and ordered list to list ingredients, steps to follow.

I nested my anchor tag into list element to add readability and to not have all my link inline.

I added on my img tag the alt attribute to describe the image and used the height and width attribute to stop the flickering of the image when refreshing the page

I added CSS onto my page and used proporties to change the style of my HTML

I also used class and Id to select the appropriate selector for styling my webpage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After learning about box-sizing and the margin,padding,border property i updated my page with new style by using the property box-sizing:border-box i also changed the margin and padding of almost all my elements.

I also updated my HTML by using div to add a container to all my html pages
